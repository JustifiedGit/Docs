# ðŸ•´ Jobs

The second menu, Jobs, contains all the current jobs on the server. In addition, it shows the name of the job, the level, and how much money you would earn with every paycheck.

Additionally, you can use this menu to switch jobs. You'll be respawned in that job by selecting the job you'd like to play and then pressing the "BECOME" button. Additionally, this menu contains two tabs. The job description includes pertinent information about the job and the rules governing what the job may and may not do. The weapons tab will display a list of all the weapons available for each job. Additionally, you can favourite a job, which moves it to the top of the list if the "Show favourite jobs" button is enabled.
