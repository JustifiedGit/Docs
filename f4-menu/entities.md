# ðŸªš Entities

The third menu is for items. It is divided into four tabs: entities, weapons shipments, and ammunition.

The Entities tab contains all the items currently available to you on the server from your current job. It contains information such as the item's name, how much it costs, what type of item it is, and how many of that item you can spawn. Each item has its own category, such as Bitminers, which are in the Bitminers 2 category, and Printers are in the Printers category. Clicking on an entity will instantly purchase it and spawn it in front of you.\
You may also favourite an entity, which will pin that job to the top of the list if the "Show favourite jobs" button is enabled.
