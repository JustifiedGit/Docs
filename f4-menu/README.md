# ðŸ“„ F4 Menu

The F4 menu is a DarkRP-specific menu that you can access by pressing the F4 key or FN + 4 on some keyboards. Many different things are available on this screen, including a dashboard, jobs, items, and death screens. It also has links to our server content, Discord, and a Steam group, among other things.

On the dashboard, you can see information such as online players, total money, job distribution, the wealthiest player online, and your favourite jobs and online staff.

\
The fifth section is for the server content. It contains links to our website, Discord, store, Steam Group, and Server Workshop content.\
The Commands tab displays a list of all available server commands, such as "drop money," "give money," and others. You'll be presented with additional options by clicking on these tabs, such as how much money to drop or give.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Jobs" %}
The second menu, Jobs, contains all the current jobs on the server. In addition, it shows the name of the job, the level, and how much money you would earn with every paycheck.

Additionally, you can use this menu to switch jobs. You'll be respawned in that job by selecting the job you'd like to play and then pressing the "BECOME" button. Additionally, this menu contains two tabs. The job description includes pertinent information about the job and the rules governing what the job may and may not do. The weapons tab will display a list of all the weapons available for each job. Additionally, you can favourite a job, which moves it to the top of the list if the "Show favourite jobs" button is enabled.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Entities" %}
The third menu is for items. It is divided into four tabs: entities, weapons shipments, and ammunition.

The Entities tab contains all the items currently available to you on the server from your current job. It contains information such as the item's name, how much it costs, what type of item it is, and how many of that item you can spawn. Each item has its own category, such as Bitminers, which are in the Bitminers 2 category, and Printers are in the Printers category. Clicking on an entity will instantly purchase it and spawn it in front of you.\
You may also favourite an entity, which will pin that job to the top of the list if the "Show favourite jobs" button is enabled.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Weapons & Ammo" %}
