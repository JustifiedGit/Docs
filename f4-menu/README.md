# ðŸ“„ F4 Menu

The F4 menu is a DarkRP-specific menu that you can access by pressing the F4 key or FN + 4 on some keyboards. Many different things are available on this screen, including a dashboard, jobs, items, and death screens. It also has links to our server content, Discord, and a Steam group, among other things.

On the dashboard, you can see information such as online players, total money, job distribution, the wealthiest player online, and your favourite jobs and online staff.

\
The fifth section is for the server content. It contains links to our website, Discord, store, Steam Group, and Server Workshop content.\
The Commands tab displays a list of all available server commands, such as "drop money," "give money," and others. You'll be presented with additional options by clicking on these tabs, such as how much money to drop or give.
