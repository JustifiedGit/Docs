    * KOS if raiding
6. Once a player has left the KOS area, you may not chase the player.
7. You may not interact with players with building signs. They may kill you if you enter.
8. You may not have KOS signs for things such as “Pointing a gun at base” or similar things.
9. You may not have multiple types of Signs (i.e., having a KOS and Building sign)
