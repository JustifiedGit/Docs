# Shooting Window Rules

1. Shooting windows must be constructed to allow the defender and raider to see and shoot at one another.
   1. This also implies that the raider must be able to shoot you with the same weapon you are using.
2. Buttons must be placed close to the shooting window within the distance of this prop (plate025x3)
3. All fading doors must be unlocked by a button. Shooting Windows cannot be opened through key bindings.
   1. For example, you cannot be too far away from the shooting window and press a keybind to open it and shoot people.
4. No-collided shooting windows are prohibited.
5. Angles must not be abused for shooting windows.
6. You cannot open Shooting Windows(i.e., Fading Doors) for a split second to shoot someone (They must be set to Toggle Mode)
7. Each shooting window side must have the same key bind.
   1. Meaning, not every fading door needs to have the same keybind unless it's a the same side/view of your base.
