# ðŸ’¸ Tip Jar

The tip jar is a feature of DarkRP that enables players to tip other players. The tip jar can be used by any player, though primarily by Hoboes and Gun Dealers.&#x20;

To use the tip jar, a player simply hit E on the tip jar and then input the desired donation amount. The tip jar will then accept the player's contribution and give it to the tip jar's owner.&#x20;

The tip jar is a terrific way to express gratitude for hard work or give back to the community.

1. Press E on tip jar
2. Enter Donation amount
3. Press Donate
