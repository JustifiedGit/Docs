# ðŸ”« Hitman

The Hitman is a job that allows players to be hired to kill other players.&#x20;



Hits can be placed on anyone, regardless of their job or faction. Hitman roles are typically taken by skilled shooters, as they will need to be able to take down their targets quickly and efficiently. Players interested in becoming a Hitman should consider joining a DarkRP server that offers this role. To get started, simply type !hitman into the chat and hit enter. You will then see a list of available hits and the corresponding prices. Select the hit you would like to attempt and confirm your purchase. Once you have accepted the hit, you will be given information on your target, including their location. Make your way to your target and eliminate them.
