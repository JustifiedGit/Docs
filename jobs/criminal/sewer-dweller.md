# â˜  Sewer Dweller

Sewer Dwellers are an aggressive form of job that lurks in the sewers. They are notoriously hostile and frequently kill on sight. They are also known to be fairly powerful, therefore caution is suggested when approaching them. It is crucial to stay cautious of your surroundings when traversing the Sewers, as Sewer Dwellers frequently set up traps and ambushes for unprepared adventurers. If you encounter a Sewer Dweller, you should avoid them if at all possible. If you must engage them, bring a large quantity of ammunition.

You can kill inhabitants on sight, but they may also kill you on sight, so it is advised to approach them with caution.
