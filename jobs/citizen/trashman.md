# ðŸ—‘ Trashman

The role of a Trashman is to clean the streets of downtown from any litter.

To begin this role, head over to your closest manhole cover or Dumpster. Press E on the manhole cover to open it, then hold down Right Mouse Button to suck up the trash. With the dumpsters, you can start sucking up trash right away!

Over time, your trash gun will fill up. Once full, head over to the Industrial Area and take a left into the recycling plant. Press Middle Mouse Button to empty your trash gun into a trash bag. This trash bag can be thrown into the Trash Recycler and compressed into a multitude of different items. The more trash you add, the better the items will be, therefore you make more money!



You can cycle through the different items using the arrow keys on the side of the screen, then press 'E' on recycle to begin the process. once finished, you can take your trash block to the Recycled Trash Buyer using your gravity gun, and sell your trash for profit!



Your trash gun will level up over time, allowing you to store more trash, and collect trash faster!



You will sometimes find pieces of trash lying around the streets. These give more trash very quickly.
